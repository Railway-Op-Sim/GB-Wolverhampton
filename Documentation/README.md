# Wolverhampton

The Wolverhampton simulation covers the local area around the city of Wolverhampton in the UK. The area originally had two stations High Level and Low Level with the latter closing to passenger traffic in 1972, and completely in 1981. The high level station remains as the principal station for the city, with services into Shropshire and Wales, the North of England and Scotland, and south towards London via Birmingham.

The simulation includes Wolverhampton station, and the bypass line between Bushbury and Portobello junctions.


## Simulation

* The included timetable takes place on the morning of March 28th 2025, covering 4 hours between 06:00 and 10:00.
* Services towards Wales and Shrewsbury continue past North Junction to exit the map just beyond Stafford Road Junction. 
* Services northward towards Manchester, Crewe and Scotland should be routed north towards Bushbury Junction and Stafford.
* Although most services via Birmingham are routed towards Coseley, take not that this is not always the case particularly with Birmingham to Shrewsbury services which enter via Portobello Junction.
* There are a couple of freight services which use the link between Bushbury and Portobello Junctions.
* Take note of the descriptions of services as they often specify which platform at Wolverhampton to use, this can help to keep things running smoothly.
